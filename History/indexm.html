                    <h2>Kingdom of Aksum</h2>
                    <p>The Aksumite Dynasty was a powerful ancient civilization that flourished in present-day Ethiopia and Eritrea between the 1st and 7th 
                        centuries CE. It was one of the great African empires, known for its advanced architecture, including massive obelisks, and its early 
                        adoption of Christianity in the 4th century under King Ezana. Aksum was a major trade hub, linking Africa with the Mediterranean, Arabia,
                        and India. The kingdom developed its own script, Ge'ez, and minted coins, showcasing its economic strength. Despite its decline due to 
                        environmental and political factors, Aksum’s legacy remains central to Ethiopian identity and Orthodox Christianity.</p>

                    <h2>Solomonic Dynasty</h2>
                    <p>The Solomonic Dynasty ruled Ethiopia from 1270 to 1974, claiming descent from the biblical King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba. Founded 
                        by Emperor Yekuno Amlak, it restored Ethiopian rule after the Zagwe Dynasty. The dynasty strengthened Orthodox Christianity, expanded 
                        the empire, and resisted foreign invasions, including the Ottoman and Italian forces. Prominent rulers like Emperor Menelik II modernized 
                        Ethiopia and defeated Italy at the Battle of Adwa in 1896. Emperor Haile Selassie, the last Solomonic ruler, introduced reforms but was 
                        overthrown in 1974. The dynasty left a lasting legacy in Ethiopian culture, religion, and national identity.</p>

                    <h2>Adal-Ethiopian Wars</h2>
                    <p>The Adal-Ethiopian Wars (1529–1543) were a series of fierce battles between the Ethiopian Empire and the Muslim Sultanate of Adal, led 
                        by Imam Ahmed Ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi, also known as Ahmed Gragn ("the Left-Handed"). The conflict began when Adal launched a jihad to 
                        expand Islamic rule, devastating Ethiopia with superior firearms acquired from the Ottomans. Ethiopian Emperor Lebna Dengel struggled 
                        to resist until Portugal intervened in 1541, sending musketeers to aid Ethiopia. After years of destruction, Ahmed Gragn was killed in 
                        battle in 1543, leading to Adal’s decline. The war reshaped Ethiopian history, weakening both sides and inviting future foreign 
                        influences.</p>

                    <h2>Reign of Emperor Menelik II</h2>
                    <p>Emperor Menelik II (1889–1913) was a transformative ruler of Ethiopia, known for modernizing the nation and defending its sovereignty. 
                        His greatest achievement was the victory at the Battle of Adwa in 1896, where Ethiopian forces decisively defeated the Italian army, 
                        making Ethiopia the only African nation to resist European colonization successfully. Menelik expanded Ethiopia’s territory, established 
                        Addis Ababa as the capital, and introduced modern infrastructure, including roads, telegraphs, and a railway. He also initiated 
                        administrative reforms and strengthened diplomatic ties with global powers. Despite health issues later in life, his reign laid the 
                        foundation for a strong, independent Ethiopia.</p>

                    <h2>Italian Occupation</h2>
                    <p>The Italian occupation of Ethiopia (1936–1941) was a five-year period during which Fascist Italy, under Benito Mussolini, invaded and 
                        briefly controlled Ethiopia. After a brutal campaign using chemical weapons and aerial bombings, Italy annexed Ethiopia into its East 
                        African Empire. Emperor Haile Selassie fled into exile and appealed to the League of Nations, but international support was limited. 
                        Ethiopian patriots (Arbegnoch) waged fierce resistance, disrupting Italian rule. In 1941, with the support of British and Commonwealth 
                        forces, Ethiopia was liberated, and Haile Selassie was restored to the throne. The occupation strengthened Ethiopian nationalism and 
                        resistance against colonial aggression.</p>

                    <h2>End of Monarchy</h2>
                    <p>The Ethiopian monarchy ended in 1974 when Emperor Haile Selassie was overthrown by the Derg, a Marxist-Leninist military junta led by 
                        Mengistu Haile Mariam. Economic struggles, corruption, famine, and rising public dissatisfaction fueled the revolution. Students, 
                        workers, and the military joined forces to depose the emperor, marking the end of a monarchy that had lasted for centuries. 
                        Haile Selassie was placed under house arrest and later died under suspicious circumstances in 1975. The Derg abolished the monarchy, 
                        declared Ethiopia a socialist state, and ruled with an iron fist, leading to years of political turmoil, civil war, and human rights 
                        abuses.</p>

                    <h2>Fall of the Derg</h2>
                    <p>The Derg regime fell in 1991 after years of civil war, economic decline, and internal dissent. Led by Mengistu Haile Mariam, the Derg 
                        ruled Ethiopia with an authoritarian socialist system, implementing land reforms but also engaging in brutal purges and mass killings 
                        known as the Red Terror. Armed opposition groups, particularly the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) and 
                        Eritrean separatists, intensified their resistance throughout the 1980s. With Soviet support dwindling, the Derg weakened, and in 
                        May 1991, the EPRDF forces entered Addis Ababa, forcing Mengistu to flee to Zimbabwe. The fall of the Derg led to Ethiopia's transition
                        to a federal system.</p>
